 OpenSUSE Setup Scripts - Help File
====================================

Welcome to OpenSUSE Setup Scripts!

1. Introduction

This is a manual that will help the users to use the OpenSUSE Setup Scripts. If you are seeing this screen, it means that you
selected the `?` option in the guided setup. If you want to exit out of this help document, press the `Q` key. It is 
recommended to read the documentation through to understand what the scripts do. Additionally, it is possible for the user 
(and is encouraged) to read the source code of the script files before running them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1A. ⚠️ WARNING

The user will need to run the scripts as root. This means that the scripts may modify the system configuration and packages.

2. The Guided Setup

The guided setup is to help users have a CLI menu for showing the list of supported scripts. It is aimed at novice and
intermediate users who would like to manually choose the scripts to be run. Here in the menu, please choose the corresponding 
number to the script that the user would like to run. If unsure about which script to run, please continue to read the help 
document.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2A. 🌐 Browser Installation

There are 4 scripts available for the user:
A) Brave Browser (https://brave.com/)
B) Google Chrome Browser (https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html)
C) Microsoft Edge Browser (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/?form=MA13FJ)
D) Zen Browser (https://zen-browser.app/)

Brave, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge have official repositories for OpenSUSE with rpm packages available.

Zen Browser does not have such a package, therefore, the tar.gz file is downloaded from the GitHub releases and is installed
under the `/opt` directory. There is no uninstaller for this yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2B. 📼 Codecs Installation

OpenSUSE does not ship multimedia codecs by default. This would mean that many of the multimedia files may not open correctly. 
To solve this problem, there are 3 scripts available for the user:

A) Codecs from the Packman repository (RECOMMENDED)
B) Codecs from the Packman Essentials repository
C) Codecs from the Main repository

More can be read about the Codecs here: 
A) https://en.opensuse.org/Codecs
B) https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Installing_codecs_from_Packman_repositories

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2C. 🛠️ Fixes And Tweaks

These are a set of fixes and tweaks to make things easier. Each of the fixes and tweaks are explained in detail below.

---------------------------------------------------------------

2C.1. Gigabyte Desktop Sleep Fix

Please read the full discussion on Reddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gigabyte/comments/p5ewjn/b550i_pro_ax_f13_bios_sleep_issue_on_linux

In some Gigabyte motherboards, there is an issue where the system cannot be put to sleep. The system shall instantly wake up
when put to sleep. This script will make the necessary changes to allow the system to go to sleep.

Should this script not work, please take a look at Percy Panelo's version on the same on:
https://github.com/PercyPanleo/OpenSUSE-Setup-Scripts

(Thank you, Percy Panelo!)

⚠️ WARNING

THIS FIX IS ONLY FOR GIGABYTE MOTHERBOARDS! DO NOT USE ON NON-GIGABYTE SYSTEMS!

---------------------------------------------------------------

2C.2. Install ICM Profiles

In the present working directory, the user needs to create a directory called `color` and place their monitor ICM profiles
inside it. The user will need to manually use the KDE Plasma display settings and locate the ICM profile under 
`/usr/share/color/` and set that as the color profile.

---------------------------------------------------------------

2C.3. Install Missing Fonts

This script will download all the Google Noto fonts from the OpenSUSE repository. This ensures that the symbols from other
languages can be rendered correctly. Usually, without this fix, any symbols from non-Latin symbols may be rendered in squares.

---------------------------------------------------------------

2C.4. SDDM Number Lock Fix

When the system starts up and boots to SDDM, the number lock is usually off. It becomes inconvenient for people to turn on 
the number lock every single time the system boots. This fix shall ensure that the number lock is turned on by default every 
time the system boots.

---------------------------------------------------------------

2C.5. Tweak Aliases

Certain aliases can be installed to the system to help in administrating the system. This script shall install the aliases to 
the `/etc/bash.bashrc.local` file

---------------------------------------------------------------

2C.6. mDNS Firewall Rules

In OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, the mDNS is not fully configured with regards to the firewall. This means that the system cannot list 
the shares available locally when using KDE Plasma. This script will allow the mDNS service to be in the `Public` and `External`
zones and allowing the shares to be discovered in Dolphin File Manager.

---------------------------------------------------------------

2C.7. OpenRGB

This script shall install and configure OpenRGB to support peripheral lighting.

⚠️ WARNING

THE CONFIGURATION SUPPORTED IS FOR AMD PCS ONLY! IF THE USER HAS AN INTEL CPU, PLEASE MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES IN THE SCRIPT 
FILE BEFORE RUNNING IT! FURTHER, A FEW MOTHERBOARDS MAY REQUIRE MORE CONFIGURATION TO GET THE OPENRGB TO WORK CORRECTLY. PLEASE 
CHECK THE OPENRGB WEBSITE, THE GITLAB REPOSITORY AND THE DOCUMENTATION FOR MORE INFORMATION.

---------------------------------------------------------------

2C.8. Install Monthly System Auto Updates

This script will create a systemd service and timer to update the system on the first day of every month. This is a setup once 
and forget script. If there are any package conflicts during the update, the update will be canceled by default. The user will 
then manually need to go check the conflicts and resolve them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2D. 📥 Package Installation

The following scripts shall download and install the packages from the OpenSUSE repositories.

3. ❓ FAQs and Support

A) How do I run the scripts?
Answer: Please check the readme file.

B) The script failed to run. Help!
Answer: Check the configuration, and please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

C) ICM profiles do not get installed! Help!
Answer: The user needs to make a `color` directory in the present working directory. Then the ICM files should be placed in
the `color` directory for the script to install it. Please do note that in KDE Plasma, the user will need to select the ICM
file in Settings -> Display -> Select ICM Profile and locate the ICM file under `/usr/share/color` directory.

D) OpenRGB did not work for me!
Answer: The user will need to make additional configurations for non-AMD hardware. A few motherboards will require special
configurations for the OpenRGB application to work. Please check the OpenRGB documentation for the same.
